#Escape Code Game N°1
****Objectif :****\
You're a high-flying hacker. The objective is to hack into the top secret servers of the WildCodeSchool, a pseudo school that is in fact a state organization, mandated to destroy the universe and destroy them.
To do this, you will have to pass 7 extremely well protected firewalls. Use all the tools at your disposal to carry out your mission. 

Good luck with that.

****Règles :****\
- Prohibition to touch the compressed code between the tags ```/*---------- Do not touch -----------*/``` and ```/*---------- End Do not touch -----------*/```
- Prohibition to open a folder or file called "DO_NOT_OPEN".

****Installation :****\
- Clone the project and go to the root of the project.
- Install the dependencies with the command: ```composer install``` then ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```
- Lunch your asset with ```yarn dev --watch``` or ```npm run watch```
- And finally, lunch your server : ```symfony server:start``` or ```php bin/console server:run```
