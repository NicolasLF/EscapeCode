#Escape Code Game N°1
****Objectif :****\
You're a high-flying hacker. The objective is to hack into the top secret servers of the WildCodeSchool, a pseudo school that is in fact a state organization, mandated to destroy the universe and destroy them.
To do this, you will have to pass 7 extremely well protected firewalls. Use all the tools at your disposal to carry out your mission. 

Good luck with that.

****Règles :****\
- Prohibition to touch the compressed code between the tags ```/*---------- Do not touch -----------*/``` and ```/*---------- End Do not touch -----------*/```
- Prohibition to open a folder or file called "DO_NOT_OPEN".

****Installation :****\
- Clone the project and go to the root of the project.
- Change the DATABASE_URL information with your own id
- You just need to lunch this command in a root directory of your project ```./install.sh``` and it's done. That's all baby ;)!

For run your project : 
- Lunch your asset with ```yarn dev --watch``` or ```npm run watch```
- And finally, lunch your server : ```symfony server:start``` or ```php bin/console server:run```
